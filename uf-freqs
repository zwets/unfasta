Usage: $(basename $0) [OPTIONS] [FILE ...]

  Count frequencies of elements in each sequence in each unfasta FILE and write
  to standard output.  If no FILE is present or when FILE is '-', read standard
  input.

  Options
   -b, --bare         Do not output the headers, only the data
   -l, --length-only  Length of sequence only, no frequencies per element
   -t, --totals       Totals across all sequences at bottom
" >&2
