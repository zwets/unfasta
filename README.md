# unfasta

_Command-line pipes and filters for genomic sequence data._

## Introduction

[Unfasta](http://io.zwets.it/unfasta) is a suite of command-line utilities for working with sequence data.

The rationale behind unfasta is to have the ability to process genomic sequence data using simple standard utilities like `grep`, `cut` and `head`, in the common [pipes and filters](http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/pipe_and_filter.html) style of Unix and GNU.

For instance:

```bash
# Compute the GC content of all sequences in a FASTA file
uf file.fa | sed -n 2~2p | tr -dc 'GC' | wc -c
```

In that pipeline,

* `uf` reads a FASTA file and outputs it in 'unfasta' format (explained [below](#the-unfasta-file-format), but essentially just FASTA without line breaks in the sequence data);
* `sed -n 2~2p` filters every second line from its input, writing to standard output only the even-numbered lines, which have the sequence data;
* `tr -dc GC` drops from its input all characters except `G` and `C`;
* `wc -c` counts the number of characters it reads and writes this to standard output.

Pipelines are a simple and powerful way to process large streams of data.  The FASTA format however is the party pooper.  By allowing (recommending even) sequence data to be formatted in lines of 80 to 120 characters, even the seemingly obvious `cat file.fa | fgrep -q 'GAATCATCTTTA'` fails with a false negative in 10-15% of cases (at query length 12, more often when longer).  Unfasta solves this problem by converting FASTA to unfasta (more [below](#the-unfasta-format)).

In principle, having `uf` and composing it with `sed`, `tr`, `wc`, etc. would beThe standard GNU Unix utilities could be sufficient, 

Unfasta won't work for everyone.  For those who grew up with `sh` and the likes of `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`, unfasta will be second nature.  For those used to looking at the world through a window while holding a mouse: welcome outside!


## Design principles

### The `unfasta` file format

The `unfasta` file format is FASTA with no line breaks in the sequence data.  So, an unfasta file could look like this:

    >id1 Sequence title 1
    CGCACTGTGGCCCCCGAATCTATCTTTACGGC... indefinite length sequence containing any character except new line
    >id2 Sequence title 2
    SEQUENCE DATA ...
    ...

As in FASTA, there can be an arbitrary number of sequences of arbitrary length.  Contrary to FASTA, sequences are never broken across lines.  This implies that every odd-numbered line starts with `>` and is a comment, and every even-numbered line contains sequence data.

The `uf` command (filter) converts a stream of FASTA to a stream of unfasta.  It can also do the reverse, but see section [unfasta *is* FASTA](#unfasta-is-fasta).

TODO
* [ ] extend `uf` to convert also EMBL format data.  
* [ ] check what to do with whitespace in sequence data (currently `uf` removes ALL whitespace)

#### Why the unfasta format?

Some examples will illustrate the benefits of the unfasta file format.

Extract all deflines using `sed` or `awk`:

```bash
$ sed -n 1~2p
$ awk 'NR%2==1'
```
  
Extract the data for the 3rd and 12th sequence:

```bash
$ sed -n 7,25p
```

Extract the header and sequence data for identifier `gi|22888`:

```bash
$ sed -n '/>gi|22888 /,+1p'
```

Extract the bases at positions 952-1238 in the first sequence:

```bash
$ sed -n 2p | cut -b 952-1238
```

Extract a 500 base fragment at position 135:

```bash
$ tail -c +135 | head -c 500	# or: cut -b 135-$((134+500))
```

How long are the Borrelia sequences?

```bash
$ awk '/Borrelia/ { getline; print length; }'
```

Does any sequence contain fragment `ACGTATAGCGGC`? 

```bash
# Wouldn't fgrep work for FASTA files too?  No, you'd get a false negative
# about once every 15 queries (at query length 12).  Pesky line breaks.
$ fgrep -q 'ACGTATAGCGGC' && echo "Yes" || echo "No"
```

#### Unfasta *is* FASTA

Technically, every unfasta file is a also a FASTA file.  There is no formal specification of the FASTA format, but none of the *de facto* specifications (see the [links below](#fasta-specification)) **mandate** a maximum line length.  Several **recommend** an 80 or 120 character limit.  My favourite interoperability adage _"be strict in what you send, lenient in what you accept"_ then implies that software which consumes FASTA must tolerate indefinite line lengths, while software that produces FASTA must write 80 character lines.

The `uf` tool has a --revert option which does precisely this.  But since the character limit recommendation was set [over 30 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA)!), technological progress has obliterated its reasons for existence, and I fail to see why we should continue to stick with them.  And of course, any FASTA consumer which fails to read longer lines _does_ violate the spec -- the length limit is only a *recommendation*, right?)  In short, don't revert unfasta back to FASTA and let's see if anything breaks.


### Pipes and Filters architecture

#### Bash is perfect for pipelines

Bash, or indeed any POSIX shell, natively supports pipelines in the most parsimonious way.  A minimum of syntax, a single `|` character, suffices to spawn two concurrent processes and a communication channel between them.  Neither process needs to be specifically written or adapted to participate in a pipeline.  Pipes connect the standard output of the left hand side process to the standard input of the right hand side process.  Processes read from their standard input and write to their standard output without being aware that there is a file or another process at either end.

#### Why pipelines are good

Shell pipelines like the GC-counter in the [Introduction](#introduction) are highly efficient, in more ways than you would realise:

* _I/O_. Apart from the obvious initial read, the pipeline performs no disc I/O.  All data travels in-memory from process to process.
* _Storage_. There is no intermediate storage of data.  Disc space requirement of the pipeline is zero.
* _Memory_. Each of the four processes needs only analyse a single byte at a time.  The theoretical memory requirement of the pipeline is 4 bytes.
* _Time_. The four processes run concurrently.  Theoretical time requirement is no worse than that of the slowest process.  The transparent parallelism provided by shell pipelines is underrated.

Apart from run-time efficiency, the pipes and filters approach of chaining simple tools together has benefits such as robustness, reusability, and simplicity in terms of cognitive load.  It suffices to understand the individual tools in order to understand their composition -- which in turn is just another stream processor.  As in functional programming (that is, in the absence of side-effects), cognitive load goes up linearly with the number of parts, not quadratically as it does in effectful systems where _N_ parts yield _NÃ—N_ potential interactions to take into account.


### Other design decisions

#### No Singletons

As in FASTA, an unfasta file contains a list of zero (does FASTA support this?) or more 'records' where record is a defline and a sequence.  All unfasta filters (`uf-*`) operates on all records in a FASTA file.  As in the R Language, single records are no special case, they are a lists of one element.

#### Comply with BLAST practices

The FASTA definition may be underspecified, but the defline definition even more so.  BLAST does put some requirements on it.  E.g. it must start with `>` followed immediately (no space) by an identifier which must not contain spaces, followed by an optional title.  The identifier must conform to a list (there are multiple ,,,), but can apparently also be a concatenation?  Local sequences must have prefix `lcl` or `gnl`.

#### Requirements for filters

Filters must read standard input and write to standard output.  Filters must produce valid unfasta output, that is pairs of lines with the first starting with `>` and the second @TODO@ what requirements for the SEQUENCE DATA?  Pragmatics: filters must be self-documenting, that is support at least the `--help` option.

#### Zero-length sequences

Unfasta supports zero-length sequences. (Does FASTA support these? If not, how to export them?)  They look like this:

    >ident1 An empty sequence
    
    >ident2 The next sequence
    SEQUENCE DATA

There are two reasons to support zero-length sequences.  Firstly, a zero-length sequence could arise in the course of a pipeline, so we must at that point either error out (because it is [required](#requirements-for-filters) that filters produce valid unfasta, or output the zero-length sequence.  Secondly, zero-length sequences fit in well with the functional (algebraic) definition of a sequence: a sequence is either the empty sequence, or an element (base, character) followed by a sequence.

#### Infinite sequences

Infinite sequences are not relevant to unfasta.  Unfasta is a file format, and no finite file can represent an infinite sequence.  In a processing node, an infinite sequence can exist, but it cannot be streamed out.  (Infinite sequences make sense for circular genomes or peptides.)
